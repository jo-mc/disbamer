How can I tell if a program is available from bash?

POSIX compatible:

command -v <the_command>
Example use:

if ! command -v COMMAND &> /dev/null
then
    echo "COMMAND could not be found"
    exit
fi
For Bash specific environments:

hash <the_command> # For regular commands. Or...
type <the_command> # To check built-ins and keywords

Explanation
Avoid which. Not only is it an external process you're launching for doing very little 
(meaning builtins like hash, type or command are way cheaper), you can also rely on the 
builtins to actually do what you want, while the effects of external commands can easily 
vary from system to system.
